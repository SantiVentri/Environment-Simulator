# Environment Simulator

Simple ecosystem simulator with plants and animals. Watch populations grow, compete for resources, and decline as the environment changes. Animals move, search for food, and reproduce based on availability and eventually die over time. Run a basic simulation from the command line.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (tested on Windows)

## Quick start

```bash
python main.py
```

## Structure

- `main.py`: simulation entry point.
- `environment.py`: environment logic.
- `animals.py`: animal models and behavior.
- `plants.py`: plant models and behavior.
- `helpers.py`: shared utilities.
